# Sudoku AutoSolver

In progress...

This is an implementation of a Sudoku puzzle solving program.

The program largely depends on computations and analysis of the data stored in arrays, but also depends on PuppeteerJS, which will fetch auto-generated Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulties from https://sudoku.com/

December 19, 2020:
Initalization of the Chromium instance and set up of the fetched puzzle data.
