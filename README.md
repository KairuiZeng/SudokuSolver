# Sudoku AutoSolver

In progress...

This is an implementation of a Sudoku puzzle solving program.

The program largely depends on computations and analysis of the data stored in arrays, and also PuppeteerJS, which will fetch auto-generated Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulties from https://sudoku.com/
